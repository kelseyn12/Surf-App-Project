**Getting Started**
http://127.0.0.1:5501/
Click on the button and surf conditions will pop up on the screen.

**Future Enhancements**
Implement other variables such as pressure drop, temperature drop, and duration, in addition to having the option to view other locations on Lake Superior by searching for other locations.
